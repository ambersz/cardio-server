# cardio-server

## Running the server
To run locally: ``` npm start ```
It will listen on port 3000 by default
 
## Testing

See spec/jasmine_examples for examples to write jasmine tests
Run the tests using ``` npm run test ```

If you need to manually test something you can run the server locally and send requests from [Postman](http://get-postman.com). 
```http://localhost:3000/{route here}```
